# Other Projets
**2020 College Students' Innovative Training Program: **
**"Library seats management system based on strength segmentation"**
I was the team leader and the main coder throughout the program. 

We used Mask-RCNN algorithm to solve the seat finding problem during college libraries' peak seasons. By analyzing the pictures captured by the cameras pre-installed in the libraries, the number and the positons of available seats can be presented to students automatically through a mobile phone app.
